# Digits_recognizer_sklearn
The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Implemented machine learning algorithm ,Random Forest to improve the accuracy of model.Random forests is a supervised learning algorithm.It is also the most flexible and easy to use algorithm.
A forest is comprised of trees. It is said that the more trees it has, the more robust a forest is. Random forests creates decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.
